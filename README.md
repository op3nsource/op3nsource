### About Us

<details>
	<summary>Know more about us here 👇 </summary>
  <br/>
  Open Source Guides were created and are curated by us - a small team of pogrammers, along with input from outside community reviewers & Coders. One reason we started this project is because we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open source projects.

  Our goal is to aggregate community best practices, and bringing open source coding accessible to every coder.
